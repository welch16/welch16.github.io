ChIP-exo/nexus experiments rely on innovative modifications of the commonly used ChIP-seq protocol for high resolution mapping of transcription factor binding sites. Although many aspects of the ChIP-exo data analysis are similar to those of ChIP-seq, these high throughput experiments pose a number of unique quality control and analysis challenges. We develop a novel statistical quality control pipeline and accompanying *R*/*Bioconductor* package, **ChIPexoQual**, to enable exploration and analysis of ChIP-exo and related   experiments. **ChIPexoQual** evaluates a number of key issues including strand imbalance, library complexity, and signal enrichment of data.

The **ChIPexoQual** package is part of [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIPexoQual.html).
